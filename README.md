# sWeatherSync
sWeatherSync is a FiveM script that synchronizes the weather in the game with real-life weather conditions. It uses live data from weather forecasts to accurately replicate the current conditions in the game, including temperature, precipitation, wind, and more. This allows players to experience a more immersive and realistic gameplay experience, as the weather in the game will match the conditions outside. The script is easy to install and use, and itâ€™s a great addition to any FiveM server.
